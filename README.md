MusicXML to MIDI converter
======================

MusicXML to MIDI converter, including accompaniment generator using [Musical MIDI Accompaniment (MMA)](http://www.mellowood.ca/mma/).

![GitHub Build Status](https://github.com/infojunkie/musicxml-midi/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

# Installation
- Install `xmllint` (included in [libxml2](http://www.xmlsoft.org/) on most platforms)
- `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- `npm install && npm run build`

# Convert a MusicXML score to MIDI
- `npm run --silent convert:unroll song.musicxml > song-unrolled.musicxml` to unroll a MusicXML score by expanding all jumps and repeats
- `npm run --silent convert:mma song.musicxml > song.mma` to both unroll a score and convert it to an MMA script
- `npm run --silent convert:groove groove-name [chords="A,B,C"] [tempo=X] [count=Y] [keysig=Z] > groove.mma` to generate a groove MMA script
- `npm run convert:midi /path/to/song.mma` to convert an MMA script to MIDI file at `/path/to/song.mid`
- `npm run --silent convert:timemap song.musicxml > song.timemap.json` to convert a score to a timemap JSON file

# Serve a conversion API endpoint
- `PORT=3000 npm run start:develop` for development (including hot-reload)
- `PORT=3000 npm run start:server` for production
- `curl -sSf -F"musicXml=@test/data/salma-ya-salama.musicxml" -F"globalGroove=Maqsum" http://localhost:3000/convert -o "salma-ya-salama.mid"`
- `curl -sSf -F"groove=Maqsum" -F"chords=I, vi, ii, V7" -F"count=8" http://localhost:3000/groove -o "maqsum.mid"`
- `curl -sSf -F"jq=.[] |= {groove,description,timeSignature}" http://localhost:3000/grooves.json`

# Other operations
- Extract an Ableton ASCL tuning from a MusicXML score: `npm run --silent convert:tuning song.musicxml > song.tuning.ascl`
- Extract a pitchset JSON listing from a MusicXML score: `npm run --silent convert:pitchset song.musicxml > song.pitchset.json`
- Scrape MusicXML examples from the official site: `./src/js/musicxml-examples.js --output=./test/data/examples`
- Convert MMA grooves to MusicXML: `./src/js/musicxml-grooves.js --output=./test/data/grooves`
- Convert MIDI to JSON and back: `./src/js/midi-json.js < source.mid | jq [..] | ./src/js/midi-json.js > target.mid`

# Theory of operation
This converter creates a valid MMA accompaniment script out of a MusicXML score. The MMA script is then converted to MIDI using the bundled `mma` tool. To accomplish this, the converter expects to find the following information in the sheet:

- Chord information, expressed as [`harmony` elements](https://w3c.github.io/musicxml/musicxml-reference/elements/harmony/). MMA recognizes a large number of chords, but MusicXML's harmony representation is more general and can lead to invalid chord names. Refer to [chords.musicxml](test/data/chords.musicxml) for a reference on how to express all MMA-supported chords.

- Melody information, expressed as [`note` elements](https://www.w3.org/2021/06/musicxml40/musicxml-reference/elements/note/). This is converted to an MMA `SOLO` sequence for each measure.

- Optional playback style information, expressed as [`sound/play/other-play` elements](https://www.w3.org/2021/06/musicxml40/musicxml-reference/elements/other-play/) with attribute `@type = 'groove'`. The content of this element represents the "groove" that is passed to MMA to generate an accompaniment. In case no such playback style information is found, or the specified style is not mapped to an existing MMA groove, the chords are played back as per the lead sheet without further accompaniment. Note that several styles can be specified in a single sheet, since the `sound` element is associated with `measure` or `measure/direction` elements. The groove can be overridden with the argument `globalGroove`.

The tools contained here can also convert the score to a so-called "timemap" JSON file, which lists timing information for each measure. This is needed for consumers that wish to synchronize the MusicXML with the MIDI, such as [`musicxml-player`](https://github.com/infojunkie/musicxml-player):
```typescript
[
  {
    // 0-based measure index (integer)
    // This index can be repeated in the timemap in case the measure itself is repeated, e.g. with |: repeated sections :| and D.S. sections.
    measure: number,

    // 0-based offset in milliseconds (real)
    timestamp: number,

    // duration in milliseconds (real)
    duration: number
  },
  // ...
]
```

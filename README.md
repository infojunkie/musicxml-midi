# musicxml-mma

A MusicXML converter to MIDI via [Musical MIDI Accompaniment (MMA)](http://www.mellowood.ca/mma/).

![GitHub Build Status](https://github.com/infojunkie/musicxml-mma/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

## Installation
- Install `xmllint` (included in [libxml2](http://www.xmlsoft.org/) on most platforms)
- `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- `npm install && npm run build:grooves && npm run build:sef`

## Converting a MusicXML score
- `npm run convert song.musicxml` to convert a MusicXML score to MIDI `song.mid`, which includes the following transformations:
- `npm run convert:unroll song.musicxml` to "unroll" a MusicXML score by expanding all jumps and repeats, to `song.unroll.musicxml`
- `npm run convert:mma song.musicxml` to both unroll a score and convert it to an MMA script `song.mma`
- `npm run convert:midi song.mma` to convert the MMA script to MIDI `song.mid`

## Serving a conversion API endpoint
- `PORT=3001 npm run develop` for development (including hot-reload)
- `PORT=3001 npm run start` for production
- `curl -sSf -F "musicXml=@test/data/salma-ya-salama.musicxml" -F "globalGroove=Maqsum" http://localhost:3001/convert -o "salma-ya-salama.mid"`

## Theory of operation
This converter aims to create a valid MMA accompaniment script out of a MusicXML lead sheet. To accomplish this, it expects to find the following information in the sheet:

- Chord information, expressed as [`harmony` elements](https://w3c.github.io/musicxml/musicxml-reference/elements/harmony/). MMA recognizes a large number of chords, but MusicXML's harmony representation is more general and can lead to invalid chord names. Refer to [chords.musicxml](test/data/chords.musicxml) for a reference on how to express all MMA-supported chords.

- Melody information, expressed as [`note` elements](https://www.w3.org/2021/06/musicxml40/musicxml-reference/elements/note/). This is converted to an MMA `SOLO` sequence for each measure.

- Optional playback style information, expressed as [`sound/play/other-play` elements](https://www.w3.org/2021/06/musicxml40/musicxml-reference/elements/other-play/) with attribute `@type = 'groove'`. The content of this element represents the "groove" that is passed to MMA to generate an accompaniment. In case no such playback style information is found, or the specified style is not mapped to an existing MMA groove, the chords are played back as per the lead sheet without further accompaniment. Note that several styles can be specified in a single sheet, since the `sound` element is associated with `measure` or `measure/direction` elements. The groove can be overridden with the argument `globalGroove`.
